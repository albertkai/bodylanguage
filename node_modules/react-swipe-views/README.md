# React Swipe Views

A React component for binded Tabs and Swipeable Views

See [Swipe Views](http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/swipe-views.html) on the Android Design Patterns website for inspiration.

Works with [React Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router), as a pure component or as a standalone component.

## Quick Example

```jsx
'use strict';

import React from 'react';
import SwipeViews from 'react-swipe-views';

export default class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <SwipeViews>
        <div title="Tab 1">
          Page 1
        </div>
        <div title="Tab 2">
          Page 2
        </div>
        <div title="Tab 3">
          Page 3
        </div>
      </SwipeViews>
    );
  }
}
```

## Install

This component is available as an npm module or a bower component:

or

## Examples

There are two example projects in the [/examples](examples) folder. One is using the npm module and webpack as a build tool with react-router, the other uses bower and brunch as a pure component.
